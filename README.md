In this project I implemented functions that allow user to: 

-- MAIN PAGE --
- add to cart
- remove from cart
- see the updated quantity of items added

-- CART PAGE --
if no item added : 
- go to home page button

if items are added :
- clear cart
- remove item
- increase / decreas quantity of item
- see the updated total bill
- see the updated cost of every item

Fully responsive design, working on every screen size.
